The global economy is expected to continue its growth trajectory, driven by advances in technology, increasing urbanization, and a growing emphasis on sustainable development. Major trends shaping the future in 2025 include the continued growth of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which are projected to account for an increasingly large share of global electricity production; the ongoing expansion of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and robotics, which are expected to continue transforming industries and creating new opportunities while also posing significant challenges related to privacy, security, and ethical considerations; and the continued evolution of urbanization, with increasing emphasis on smart cities, sustainable infrastructure, and integrated transportation systems.\n"
